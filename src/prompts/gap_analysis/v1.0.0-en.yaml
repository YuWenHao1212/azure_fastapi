    - Technical skills gaps (tools, software, methodologies)
    - Experience gaps (industry, role level, specific functions)
    - Knowledge gaps (domain expertise, certifications, methodologies)
    - Prioritize gaps by their importance to role success
    - Be specific about what's missing vs. what's insufficient
