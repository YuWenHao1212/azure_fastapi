  changes_from_v1.0.0: |
    - Reduced temperature to 0.0 (already at 0.0, kept for clarity)
    - Added seed for each round to improve reproducibility
    - Added few-shot examples for better consistency
    - Specified exact number of keywords (20) instead of range
    - Enhanced standardization rules

llm_config:
  # 溫度設為 0 是最重要的一致性參數
  temperature: 0.0
  
  # 固定最大 token 數
  max_tokens: 400
  
  # Seed 可以提高可重現性（但 Azure OpenAI 可能不完全支援）
  seed: 42
  
  # Top-p 設為 1.0 避免任何 token 被排除
  top_p: 1.0
  
  # 頻率和存在懲罰設為 0，避免影響一致性

    You are an expert at extracting CONSISTENT, standardized keywords for job matching.
    
    CRITICAL: You MUST always use the exact same standard form for the same concepts.
    
    MANDATORY STANDARDIZATION RULES:
    1. Remove ALL unnecessary qualifiers and suffixes
    2. Use the shortest, most common industry term
    3. Be 100% consistent across all extractions
    4. Always return EXACTLY 20 keywords, no more, no less
    
    REQUIRED TRANSFORMATIONS (you MUST follow these exactly):
    - "Python programming" → "Python"
    - "Python development" → "Python"
    - "machine learning algorithms" → "Machine Learning"
    - "ML algorithms" → "Machine Learning"
    - "AWS cloud services" → "AWS"
    - "Amazon Web Services" → "AWS"
    - "data visualization tools" → "Data Visualization"
    - "data visualization software" → "Data Visualization"
    - "React.js" → "React"
    - "Node.js" → "Node.js"
    - "software development" → "Software Development"
    - "project management skills" → "Project Management"
    - "compensation and benefits" → "Compensation and Benefits"
    - "HR compensation & benefits" → "Compensation and Benefits"
    
    EXAMPLES OF CORRECT EXTRACTION:
    
    Input: "Senior Python Developer with machine learning algorithms experience and AWS cloud services knowledge"
    Output: {"keywords": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "AWS", "Software Development", "Senior Developer", ...]}
    
    Input: "Data analyst with data visualization tools and Python programming skills"  
    Output: {"keywords": ["Data Analysis", "Data Visualization", "Python", "Analytics", ...]}

    Your task:
    1. Extract EXACTLY 20 most important keywords
    2. Apply the standardization rules STRICTLY
    3. Rank by importance for job matching
    4. Return consistent terminology EVERY TIME
    5. If you see similar concepts, use the STANDARD form
    
    Job Description:
    {job_description}
    
    Return only JSON with exactly 20 keywords: {"keywords": ["term1", "term2", ..., "term20"]}
