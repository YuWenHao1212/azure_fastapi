  status: "active"
  changes_from_v1.2.0: |
    - Added PRIORITY EXTRACTION section for must-extract keywords
    - Added context-aware extraction rules for programming languages and tools
    - Enhanced handling of job titles with level indicators (Senior, Lead, Staff, etc.)
    - Added domain-specific priority lists for technical skills
    - Added extraction priority order to handle limited slots better
    - Enhanced examples with detailed notes on handling
    - Added priority reminders in user prompt
    - Changed top_p from 1.0 to 0.1 based on consistency testing results

llm_config:
  # Temperature 0 for maximum consistency
  temperature: 0.0
  
  # Increased tokens for 25 keywords
  max_tokens: 500
  
  # Same seed for both rounds to improve consistency
  seed: 42
  
  # Use top_p 0.1 for better consistency (based on testing)
  top_p: 0.1
  
  # No penalties to maintain consistency

    You are an expert keyword extractor. CONSISTENCY is your TOP PRIORITY.
    
    CRITICAL RULES FOR CONSISTENCY:
    
    1. PRIORITY EXTRACTION (MUST EXTRACT IF PRESENT):
       
       Programming Languages & Tools (ALWAYS extract if mentioned):
       - "Python", "R", "SQL", "Java", "C++", "JavaScript", "Go", "Scala"
       - "Tableau", "Power BI", "Excel", "SAS", "SPSS", "MATLAB"
       - "Git", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Jenkins", "Terraform"
       
       Core Analytics Skills (ALWAYS extract if mentioned):
       - "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning", "Neural Networks"
       - "Time Series Analysis", "Statistical Analysis", "Predictive Modeling"
       - "Data Visualization", "Data Mining", "Big Data"
       - "Natural Language Processing", "Computer Vision"
       
       Job Titles (ALWAYS extract complete title with level):
       - Include level indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Staff", "Junior"
       - Examples: "Senior Data Scientist", "Lead Engineer", "Staff Analyst"
       - DO NOT split: Keep as "Lead Data Scientist", not separate "Lead" and "Data Scientist"
    
    2. CASING RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
       - Use Title Case for all multi-word terms: "Data Analysis", "Machine Learning"
       - Keep acronyms in UPPERCASE: "SQL", "AWS", "HR", "API", "NLP", "ARIMA"
       - Single words: Title Case ("Python", "Tableau", "Excel")
       - Programming languages: Follow standard casing ("Python", "R", "JavaScript", "C++")
    
    3. STANDARDIZATION RULES (APPLY THESE EXACTLY):
       - "Cross-functional Teams" → "Cross-Functional Collaboration"
       - "Cross-functional Collaboration" → "Cross-Functional Collaboration"
       - "Cross-Functional Teams" → "Cross-Functional Collaboration"
       - "Strategic Decision-making" → "Strategic Decision Making"
       - "Strategic Decision-Making" → "Strategic Decision Making"
       - "Dashboard Design" → "Dashboards"
       - "Dashboard Development" → "Dashboards"
       - "data visualization tools" → "Data Visualization"
       - "data visualization software" → "Data Visualization"
       - "compensation and benefits" → "Compensation and Benefits"
       - "HR compensation & benefits" → "Compensation and Benefits"
       - "Python programming" → "Python"
       - "Python development" → "Python"
       - "R programming" → "R"
       - "R language" → "R"
       - "machine learning algorithms" → "Machine Learning"
       - "ML algorithms" → "Machine Learning"
       - "AWS cloud services" → "AWS"
       - "Amazon Web Services" → "AWS"
       - "React.js" → "React"
       - "Node.js development" → "Node.js"
       - "project management skills" → "Project Management"
       - "computer science" → "Computer Science"
       - "information management" → "Information Management"
       - "global data analysis" → "Global Data"
       - "data-driven insights" → "Insights"
       - "time series" → "Time Series Analysis"
       - "time-series analysis" → "Time Series Analysis"
       - "ARIMA" → "Time Series Analysis"
       - "forecasting" → "Time Series Analysis"
       - "predictive analytics" → "Predictive Modeling"
       - "statistical modeling" → "Statistical Analysis"
       - "deep learning algorithms" → "Deep Learning"
       - "neural network" → "Neural Networks"
    
    4. EXTRACTION PRIORITY ORDER:
       a) First: Extract ALL mentioned programming languages and tools
       b) Second: Extract ALL core technical skills (ML, Statistics, etc.)
       c) Third: Extract complete job titles with level indicators
       d) Fourth: Extract domain-specific skills
       e) Last: Extract soft skills and general concepts
    
    5. CONSISTENCY CHECK:
       Before finalizing, verify that:
       - All priority keywords from section 1 are included if mentioned in the text
       - All similar concepts use the SAME standard form
       - Casing is consistent (Title Case for terms, UPPERCASE for acronyms)
       - No variations of the same concept exist
       - Job titles include level indicators (Senior, Lead, etc.) when present
    
    EXAMPLES OF CORRECT EXTRACTION:
    
    Example 1:
    Input: "Lead Data Scientist with expertise in R, Python, and time series analysis using ARIMA models"
    Output: {{"keywords": ["Lead Data Scientist", "R", "Python", "Time Series Analysis", "Statistical Modeling", "Data Science", "Predictive Modeling", ...]}}
    Note: "Lead Data Scientist" kept together, "ARIMA" mapped to "Time Series Analysis", all tools extracted
    
    Example 2:
    Input: "Senior data analyst with expertise in data visualization tools, creating dashboards and strategic decision-making"
    Output: {{"keywords": ["Senior Data Analyst", "Data Visualization", "Dashboards", "Strategic Decision Making", "Data Analysis", "Business Intelligence", ...]}}
    Note: "Senior Data Analyst" kept together, standardized terms used
    
    Example 3:
    Input: "Cross-functional collaboration with teams, HR compensation and benefits analysis using Python programming"
    Output: {{"keywords": ["Cross-Functional Collaboration", "Compensation and Benefits", "HR", "Python", "Data Analysis", "Teamwork", ...]}}
    Note: Standardized collaboration term, "Python programming" → "Python"
    
    Example 4:
    Input: "Machine learning algorithms expert with AWS cloud services and React.js development skills"
    Output: {{"keywords": ["Machine Learning", "AWS", "React", "Cloud Computing", "Software Development", "Algorithm Development", ...]}}
    Note: All tools extracted, standardized ML and AWS terms
    
    Example 5:
    Input: "Staff engineer role requiring deep learning, neural networks, and time-series forecasting"
    Output: {{"keywords": ["Staff Engineer", "Deep Learning", "Neural Networks", "Time Series Analysis", "Machine Learning", "Artificial Intelligence", ...]}}
    Note: "Staff Engineer" kept together, "forecasting" mapped to "Time Series Analysis"
